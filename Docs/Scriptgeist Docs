# Scriptgeist Documentation

This documentation provides detailed information on each major component of the **Scriptgeist** project. It includes usage instructions, capabilities, platform support, and security considerations.

---

## 1. Introduction

Scriptgeist is a cross-platform, modular cybersecurity and system auditing framework written in PowerShell. It supports Windows, Linux, and macOS, and includes modules for monitoring, threat response, reporting, and GUI-based interaction.

---

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 `Scriptgeist.psm1`

**Purpose:** Acts as the core module loader and dispatcher for all subcomponents.

**Capabilities:**

* Dynamically imports submodules (Monitor, Responder, Reporter, etc.).
* Provides the `Invoke-Scriptgeist` entry point.
* Supports command-line and GUI interfaces.
* Enables notifications, cross-platform compatibility, and environment detection.

**Usage:**

```powershell
Import-Module ./Scriptgeist.psm1
Invoke-Scriptgeist -GUI
```

## 3. Monitor Modules

### 3.1 `Watch-NetworkAnomalies.ps1`

**Purpose:** Detects suspicious network behavior such as unauthorized connections, DNS anomalies, and bandwidth spikes.

**Capabilities:**

* Logs frequent external IPs and domains.
* Flags suspicious TLDs (e.g., `.ru`, `.tk`).
* Supports GeoIP integration and optional reverse lookups.
* Alerts on significant outbound traffic or port scans.

**Cross-Platform:** Yes

### 3.2 `Watch-LogTampering.ps1`

**Purpose:** Detects potential log tampering activity or missing entries.

**Capabilities:**

* Validates sequence and integrity of logs.
* Alerts if logs are cleared or backdated.
* Adapts behavior if admin privileges are unavailable.

**Cross-Platform:** Yes (Windows: EventLogs; Linux: journalctl or `/var/log`)

### 3.3 `Watch-GuestSessions.ps1`

**Purpose:** Detects use of guest or untrusted sessions.

**Capabilities:**

* Checks for logins from guest accounts.
* Tracks logon type and session sources.
* Can operate in background or interactively.

**Cross-Platform:** Yes

### 3.4 `Watch-SystemIntegrity.ps1`

**Purpose:** Monitors system binaries and configuration files for unauthorized changes.

**Capabilities:**

* Hash checks for critical binaries.
* Flags changes to sudoers, registry hives, or startup configs.
* Can be customized with whitelist/blacklist.

**Cross-Platform:** Yes

### 3.5 `Watch-PersistenceMechanisms.ps1`

**Purpose:** Detects common persistence mechanisms used by malware or intruders.

**Capabilities:**

* Registry `Run` keys (Windows).
* Scheduled tasks, crontabs.
* Startup folders, launch agents.

**Cross-Platform:** Yes

## 4. Responder Modules

### 4.1 `Respond-TerminateThreat.ps1`

**Purpose:** Terminates suspicious or malicious processes based on given PID or name.

**Usage:**

```powershell
Respond-TerminateThreat -ProcessName "suspicious.exe"
```

### 4.2 `Respond-IsolateSystem.ps1`

**Purpose:** Immediately cuts off external communications for the current machine.

**Capabilities:**

* Disables network interfaces.
* Kills active connections.
* (Optional) Locks workstation.

### 4.3 `Respond-RestoreBackup.ps1`

**Purpose:** Restores system or file snapshots from trusted backups.

**Usage:**

```powershell
Respond-RestoreBackup -TargetPath "C:\ImportantData" -From "Z:\Backups"
```

---

## 5. Reporter Modules

### 5.1 `Export-GeistReport.ps1`

**Purpose:** Exports analysis and monitoring output into secure, structured reports.

**Capabilities:**

* Supports `Text`, `JSON`, and `HTML` formats.
* Optional redaction and password-protected zip export.
* Adds system metadata: hostname, uptime, user, threat level.
* Can be set to prevent deletion without password.

**Usage:**

```powershell
Export-GeistReport -Format HTML -ReportPath "C:\Reports\Threat.html" -Encrypt
```

---

## 6. GUI Tools

### 6.1 `ScriptgeistGUI.ps1`

**Purpose:** Provides an intuitive Windows Forms GUI for launching scans, selecting modules, and exporting reports.

**Capabilities:**

* Dropdowns and file selectors.
* Integrated viewer for report previews.
* Real-time log output window.

---

## 7. CLI Tools

### 7.1 `Invoke-Scriptgeist.ps1`

**Purpose:** Primary CLI entry point that dynamically invokes any combination of monitoring, responding, and reporting logic.

**Capabilities:**

* Accepts command-line switches: `-FetchLogs`, `-AttentionOnly`, `-ReportFormat`, `-Colorize`.
* Chained execution of modules with audit logging.

**Example:**

```powershell
Invoke-Scriptgeist -FetchLogs -LogType System -AttentionOnly -Colorize -ReportFormat JSON -ReportPath "./Report.json"
```

---

## 8. Security Considerations

* All modules log activity via `Write-GeistLog`.
* Sensitive output can be redacted.
* File tampering or unauthorized access attempts are recorded.
* Supports elevation-aware behavior.

---

## 9. Platform Notes

* **Windows:** Full feature support including Event Logs, Registry, and GUI.
* **Linux/macOS:** Uses journalctl and file-based logs, all watcher and responder modules supported except GUI.
* Ensure PowerShell 7+ for full compatibility across OSes.

---

## 10. Roadmap (Optional Section)

* Add cloud-based sync for reports.
* Integrate with Microsoft Defender / Linux auditd.
* Real-time notification to mobile/email.
